  <h2>New House Listing</h2>

  In order to not bid multiple times on the same house, we use RedFin links to identify each house.  Enter a valid RedFin house link to bid on a new house (we will confirm it does not already exist).  A RedFin link looks like this:<br><code>https://www.redfin.com/CA/Oakland/350-Lester-Ave-94606/home/1159447</code>.<br><br>

  We will verify the asking price you enter.  There is no point in cheating.  We only ask you to enter this so as not to violate the RedFin terms of use.<br><br>
